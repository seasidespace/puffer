//! Trait surface and DTOs for the puffer tool runner.
//!
//! A `ToolRunner` abstracts everything that historically required direct
//! filesystem / process / MCP access from inside the puffer runtime. There
//! are two concrete implementations:
//!
//! * `LocalToolRunner` (in `puffer-runner-local`) — runs in-process and
//!   delegates to the existing claude-parity executors.
//! * `RemoteToolRunner` (planned, in `puffer-runner-grpc`) — forwards every
//!   call to a remote `puffer-tool-runner` server over gRPC.
//!
//! All DTOs are owned (no borrowed references to runtime state) so the same
//! types can cross a gRPC boundary unchanged.
//!
//! Note: this is the Phase 0 trait extraction. Call-site refactors that make
//! the runtime hold an `Arc<dyn ToolRunner>` instead of calling concrete
//! functions directly are not yet wired in — see the crate-level README and
//! task notes for the remaining phases.
